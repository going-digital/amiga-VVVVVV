# A500 feasibility prototype

This native slice runs original rooms **(100,110)** and **(119,110)** on a PAL A500 with 512 KiB
Chip RAM and 512 KiB slow RAM. It has player movement, gravity flipping, static
tile collision, spikes, checkpoint activation, death and respawn. It starts at
room (100,110)'s ceiling checkpoint, rather than the campaign starting position.

Moving left from (100,110) enters (119,110), preserving movement state; moving
right returns. Checkpoints retain their room, position and gravity for respawn.
Other exits return to the saved checkpoint and show a notice. Moving entities,
scripts, wider campaign progression, keyboard controls and music remain unimplemented. See [the port plan](../AMIGA_PORT_PLAN.md).

## Build and run

From the repository root on this Mac:

```sh
make -C amiga_version all
make -C amiga_version test
make -C amiga_version capture
make -C amiga_version capture-transitions
make -C amiga_version run
```

- `all`: host asset conversion, Bartman 68000 compile, ELF/Hunk output, bootable ADF.
- `test`: compare the C RLE decoder against every extracted campaign tile array,
  validate malformed packets, compare player physics with extracted original C++
  methods, and run UBSan session lifecycle checks.
- `capture`: deterministic Copperline input, screenshot, memory/timing assertions,
  audio capture, and a resumed-state clean-exit check. Runs headlessly.
- `capture-transitions`: builds a separate test-only input replay in
  `build/amiga-transitions`, verifies the world-wrap crossing without death,
  captures the neighboring room, then checks cross-room respawn and clean exit.
- `run`: interactive Copperline window. Joystick left/right moves;
  fire flips gravity when supported. Right mouse restarts from the checkpoint;
  left mouse exits to AmigaDOS. Keyboard input is not implemented yet.

The default toolchain is discovered under
`~/.vscode/extensions/bartmanabyss.amiga-debug-*`, the emulator is
`/Applications/Copperline.app`, and the ROM is `~/amiga/KICK13.ROM`.
The asset default is the local Steam installation:
`~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/vvvvvv/VVVVVV.app/Contents/Resources/data.zip`.
Override paths with `BARTMAN=...`, `TOOLS=...`, `COPPERLINE=...`, `CTL=...`,
`ROM=...`, and `DATA=...` on the make command. Quote overrides containing spaces.
Host dependencies are Python 3, a C/C++ compiler, and make. The physics reference
currently expects SDL3 under `/opt/homebrew`. PNG decoding uses
the repository's LodePNG code and needs no Python packages.

`build/amiga/` contains all generated assets and output, and is ignored by Git.
The supplied ROM/archive are read only. No Workbench disk image is needed for
this generated AmigaDOS boot disk. Converted proprietary assets must not be
committed or bundled for distribution without the relevant permission.

## What is implemented

- PAL-only 320×240, two bitplanes, double buffering per cached room; stock 68000, OCS,
  512 KiB Chip RAM + 512 KiB slow RAM, no Fast RAM/FPU.
- Native Copper display, hardware sprite 0 for the player, blitter HUD copies,
  palette conversion, and Paula DMA for one short converted effect.
- A 34 ms gameplay tick accumulated from PAL refresh periods. Static player
  physics preserve the original input/contact/velocity/X/Y collision order.
- Integer 8.24 velocities and explicit binary32 rounding, including rounding
  before position truncation. No floating-point runtime is linked on the Amiga.
- Four colours in the playfield: black, a room accent, green checkpoints and
  white text. Low-intensity tile shading is removed; both rooms retain their
  outlines and hazards. The cyan player uses an independent sprite palette.
- The visible player fits source columns 6–21 and uses one 16-pixel sprite.
  Two DMA lists publish animation/position with the completed screen. The
  other seven channels are unused; moving-object allocation/multiplexing and
  a general blitter fallback are still to be implemented.
- Two screen pairs remain cached in Chip RAM; original room backgrounds live
  in slow RAM. Only checkpoint damage needs CPU restoration. The earlier repeating-room scroll
  stress harness has been replaced; actual tower streaming remains outstanding.
- Copper waits until line 44 before reading buffer pointers, so publication
  after the VBL interrupt completes before visible display starts at line 52.
  Sprite pointers are published earlier, at line 20, before sprite control DMA.
- Hardware ownership/restoration and a bounded startup allocation; no OS calls
  inside the main hardware takeover loop.
- Offline room pack covering literal tile initializers, including zero-filled
  defaults and conditional variants. The source location is the authoritative
  record identity, **not** a ready-to-use room-coordinate lookup. Room setup
  C++ code, scripts, and tower data are outside this pack's scope. A separate,
  strictly bounded export includes the two slice rooms' literal checkpoint setup
  and rejects unsupported setup statements.

## Measured result, 27 September 2026

The current automated capture uses Kickstart 1.3 and Copperline's stock A500
cycle timing with 512K Chip + 512K slow RAM. At the 16.5-second memory snapshot:

| Measurement | Result |
|---|---:|
| Room arrays, including explicit-size defaults | 422 |
| Raw tile bytes | 1,012,800 |
| Packed tile bytes, including directory | 252,832 |
| Unique packed payloads | 406 |
| Prototype explicit Chip RAM allocation | 80,030 bytes |
| Free Chip RAM after startup allocation | 378,424 bytes |
| Free non-Chip RAM after startup allocation | 425,376 bytes (interactive build) |
| Maximum measured update/draw work | 245 PAL lines / 15.68 ms (transition replay) |
| Maximum room-change redraw | 240 PAL lines / 15.36 ms |
| Missed VBL observations including transitions | 0 |
| VBL periods crossed by room-change work | 0 |
| Flip, checkpoint, spike death and respawn | Passed |
| Captured flip audio signal | Passed |
| World wrap and cross-room respawn | Passed |
| Return to AmigaDOS | Passed |

These are **emulator measurements of this harness**, not real-hardware or
complete-game performance. The RAM totals do not include a resident full room
pack: only two compressed rooms and their decoded tile/background caches are
resident. A cache per room is temporary slice scaffolding, not the full-campaign
storage design. The ordinary capture peaks at 210 lines / 13.44 ms. During a snapshot
the current tick can be one ahead of the completed-render counter.

Reports and evidence:

- `build/amiga/smoke-report.json`: current timing, RAM, input/audio/exit assertions.
- `build/amiga/prototype.png` and `exit.png`: game display and restored AmigaDOS.
- `build/amiga/prototype.wav`: captured audio.
- `build/amiga/size-report.json`: executable sections/symbol sizes.
- `build/amiga/rooms.json`: tile record manifest and source hashes.
- `build/amiga/assets.json`: asset inventory and input fingerprint.
- `build/amiga/transition-test-report.json`: boundary reference coverage/hash.
- `build/amiga-transitions/smoke-report.json` and `neighbor.png`: target replay
  diagnostics and the second-room display.

The physics test compiles original C++ method bodies extracted from the desktop
sources and compares every state field with the integer core: **181 scenarios,
36,746 ticks, zero differences**, plus **53,280 hazard rectangle cases**. The
reference extraction is recorded with a hash in `player-test-report.json`.
This covers isolated static player physics, not the complete desktop game loop,
all entity interactions, or exhaustive possible states. Session timing checks
cover checkpoint activation, 30-tick death delay, respawn control lock and the
explicit slice exit fallback, checkpoint changes across rooms, and the original
room geometry replay. A separate test compares **32,400 normal-world boundary
cases** with code extracted from `Logic.cpp` and `Map.cpp`, including vertical-
before-horizontal ordering, thresholds, world wrap and retained movement state.
It excludes special-room transitions and the full `loadlevel` side effects.
The desktop Release build also succeeds in
`build/desktop`; full-game reference runs are still outstanding.

Room changes now select the cached screen pair and update checkpoint/HUD damage.
The explicit loading pause has been removed: transition time is included in the
same clock and missed-VBL checks as other work. The tested replay meets the
provisional 20% video headroom target, including room changes. This does not
establish worst-case full-game performance or real-hardware behavior.

The previous four-plane build used 161,486 Chip bytes and peaked at 45.312 ms
for room redraw. The new arrangement uses another 38,400 bytes of static slow-RAM
background storage and removes runtime full-screen copies. Only two rooms are
cached; the general campaign cache remains to be designed.

`PLANES=4` retains an experimental colour comparison build. Use a separate
`BUILD=/absolute/path` output directory for it; the automated performance gates
are for the default two-plane build. Prototype compilation is forced so changing
render flags cannot silently reuse an old object.

## Next implementation step

Add moving hazards and platforms, a bounded hardware-sprite allocator and
blitter fallback with reference traces covering entity/update ordering. Expand the
strict room-setup export and add full desktop-loop traces. The target replay
currently asserts milestones rather than comparing every target state field. Tower row streaming and the
music storage/playback experiment remain separate feasibility gates.

The 252,832-byte simple-RLE pack exceeds the plan's provisional 128 KiB combined
content/cache budget before scripts. Evaluate stronger compression and regional
loading; do not assume the entire campaign pack can stay resident unchanged.

The lifecycle checks pass with UBSan. An AddressSanitizer build stalled on this
host and was interrupted; ASan validation is not claimed.
