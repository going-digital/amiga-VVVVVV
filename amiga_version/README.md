# A500 feasibility prototype

This native slice runs original rooms **(100,110)** and **(119,110)** on a PAL A500 with 512 KiB
Chip RAM and 512 KiB slow RAM. It has player movement, gravity flipping, static
tile collision, spikes, checkpoint activation, death and respawn. It starts at
room (100,110)'s ceiling checkpoint, rather than the campaign starting position.

Moving left from (100,110) enters (119,110), preserving movement state; moving
right returns. Checkpoints retain their room, position and gravity for respawn.
Other exits return to the saved checkpoint and show a notice. Moving entities,
scripts, wider campaign progression, keyboard controls and music remain unimplemented. See [the port plan](../AMIGA_PORT_PLAN.md).

## Build and run

From the repository root on this Mac:

```sh
make -C amiga_version all
make -C amiga_version test
make -C amiga_version capture
make -C amiga_version capture-transitions
make -C amiga_version run
```

- `all`: host asset conversion, Bartman 68000 compile, ELF/Hunk output, bootable ADF.
- `test`: compare the C RLE decoder against every extracted campaign tile array,
  validate malformed packets, compare player physics with extracted original C++
  methods, and run UBSan session lifecycle checks.
- `capture`: deterministic Copperline input, screenshot, memory/timing assertions,
  audio capture, and a resumed-state clean-exit check. Runs headlessly.
- `capture-transitions`: builds a separate test-only input replay in
  `build/amiga-transitions`, verifies the world-wrap crossing without death,
  captures the neighboring room, then checks cross-room respawn and clean exit.
- `run`: interactive Copperline window. Joystick left/right moves;
  fire flips gravity when supported. Right mouse restarts from the checkpoint;
  left mouse exits to AmigaDOS. Keyboard input is not implemented yet.

The default toolchain is discovered under
`~/.vscode/extensions/bartmanabyss.amiga-debug-*`, the emulator is
`/Applications/Copperline.app`, and the ROM is `~/amiga/KICK13.ROM`.
The asset default is the local Steam installation:
`~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/vvvvvv/VVVVVV.app/Contents/Resources/data.zip`.
Override paths with `BARTMAN=...`, `TOOLS=...`, `COPPERLINE=...`, `CTL=...`,
`ROM=...`, and `DATA=...` on the make command. Quote overrides containing spaces.
Host dependencies are Python 3, a C/C++ compiler, and make. The physics reference
currently expects SDL3 under `/opt/homebrew`. PNG decoding uses
the repository's LodePNG code and needs no Python packages.

`build/amiga/` contains all generated assets and output, and is ignored by Git.
The supplied ROM/archive are read only. No Workbench disk image is needed for
this generated AmigaDOS boot disk. Converted proprietary assets must not be
committed or bundled for distribution without the relevant permission.

## What is implemented

- PAL-only 320×240, four bitplanes, double buffering; stock 68000, OCS,
  512 KiB Chip RAM + 512 KiB slow RAM, no Fast RAM/FPU.
- Native Copper display, blitter restoration/masked sprite drawing, palette
  conversion, and Paula DMA for one short converted effect.
- A 34 ms gameplay tick accumulated from PAL refresh periods. Static player
  physics preserve the original input/contact/velocity/X/Y collision order.
- Integer 8.24 velocities and explicit binary32 rounding, including rounding
  before position truncation. No floating-point runtime is linked on the Amiga.
- Per-buffer rectangle restoration, animated masked player drawing, and a
  checkpoint baked into each of two cached backgrounds. The earlier repeating-room scroll
  stress harness has been replaced; actual tower streaming remains outstanding.
- Copper waits until line 44 before reading buffer pointers, so publication
  after the VBL interrupt completes before visible display starts at line 52.
- Hardware ownership/restoration and a bounded startup allocation; no OS calls
  inside the main hardware takeover loop.
- Offline room pack covering literal tile initializers, including zero-filled
  defaults and conditional variants. The source location is the authoritative
  record identity, **not** a ready-to-use room-coordinate lookup. Room setup
  C++ code, scripts, and tower data are outside this pack's scope. A separate,
  strictly bounded export includes the two slice rooms' literal checkpoint setup
  and rejects unsupported setup statements.

## Measured result, 27 September 2026

The current automated capture uses Kickstart 1.3 and Copperline's stock A500
cycle timing with 512K Chip + 512K slow RAM. At the 16.5-second memory snapshot:

| Measurement | Result |
|---|---:|
| Room arrays, including explicit-size defaults | 422 |
| Raw tile bytes | 1,012,800 |
| Packed tile bytes, including directory | 252,832 |
| Unique packed payloads | 406 |
| Prototype explicit Chip RAM allocation | 161,486 bytes |
| Free Chip RAM after startup allocation | 296,968 bytes |
| Free non-Chip RAM after startup allocation | 463,056 bytes (interactive build) |
| Maximum measured update/draw work | 309 PAL lines / 19.776 ms (transition replay) |
| Maximum room-change redraw | 708 PAL lines / 45.312 ms |
| Missed VBL observations outside loading | 0 |
| VBL periods spent loading during transition replay | 6 |
| Flip, checkpoint, spike death and respawn | Passed |
| Captured flip audio signal | Passed |
| World wrap and cross-room respawn | Passed |
| Return to AmigaDOS | Passed |

These are **emulator measurements of this harness**, not real-hardware or
complete-game performance. The RAM totals do not include a resident full room
pack: only two compressed rooms and their decoded tile/background caches are
resident. A cache per room is temporary slice scaffolding, not the full-campaign
storage design. The ordinary capture peaks at 296 lines / 18.944 ms. During a snapshot
the current tick can be one ahead of the completed-render counter.

Reports and evidence:

- `build/amiga/smoke-report.json`: current timing, RAM, input/audio/exit assertions.
- `build/amiga/prototype.png` and `exit.png`: game display and restored AmigaDOS.
- `build/amiga/prototype.wav`: captured audio.
- `build/amiga/size-report.json`: executable sections/symbol sizes.
- `build/amiga/rooms.json`: tile record manifest and source hashes.
- `build/amiga/assets.json`: asset inventory and input fingerprint.
- `build/amiga/transition-test-report.json`: boundary reference coverage/hash.
- `build/amiga-transitions/smoke-report.json` and `neighbor.png`: target replay
  diagnostics and the second-room display.

The physics test compiles original C++ method bodies extracted from the desktop
sources and compares every state field with the integer core: **181 scenarios,
36,746 ticks, zero differences**, plus **53,280 hazard rectangle cases**. The
reference extraction is recorded with a hash in `player-test-report.json`.
This covers isolated static player physics, not the complete desktop game loop,
all entity interactions, or exhaustive possible states. Session timing checks
cover checkpoint activation, 30-tick death delay, respawn control lock and the
explicit slice exit fallback, checkpoint changes across rooms, and the original
room geometry replay. A separate test compares **32,400 normal-world boundary
cases** with code extracted from `Logic.cpp` and `Map.cpp`, including vertical-
before-horizontal ordering, thresholds, world wrap and retained movement state.
It excludes special-room transitions and the full `loadlevel` side effects.
The desktop Release build also succeeds in
`build/desktop`; full-game reference runs are still outstanding.

Room changes redraw both screen buffers over two render passes. This uses an
explicit loading pause: elapsed load time is discarded rather than producing
catch-up physics ticks. Loading is separately measured and excluded from the
normal missed-VBL counter. Removing this pause and verifying full-game timing
remain acceptance gates.

The measured draw/update peak leaves less than the plan's 20% video headroom.
Adding entities needs further profiling and optimization. These measurements
do not establish worst-case complete-game performance or real-hardware behavior.

## Next implementation step

Optimize normal rendering and room-change redraws, then add moving hazards and
platforms with reference traces covering entity/update ordering. Expand the
strict room-setup export and add full desktop-loop traces. The target replay
currently asserts milestones rather than comparing every target state field. Tower row streaming and the
music storage/playback experiment remain separate feasibility gates.

The 252,832-byte simple-RLE pack exceeds the plan's provisional 128 KiB combined
content/cache budget before scripts. Evaluate stronger compression and regional
loading; do not assume the entire campaign pack can stay resident unchanged.

The lifecycle checks pass with UBSan. An AddressSanitizer build stalled on this
host and was interrupted; ASan validation is not claimed.
